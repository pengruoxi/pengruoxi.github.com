                        Because of the topic of our studio this time, the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a> by Amir Dori is pretty effective and provides many useful ideas and details about game design for me. Although this article is mainly focus on the mobile phone games, some of the techniques are useful in the web game design. Several parts that I found interesting are sliders, pop-ups, and user choices. There are many design tips related to in-game purchases and ratings in the article, but they are not something I would use in web design at this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One simple but effective technique is that using different colors to create different expression for users. For example, the option that good for the game can be green and be placed on the right, while the option that bad for the game can be red and on the right. Also, when the users click on the dim background, the pop-ups should be closed as a cancel button is clicked. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to my own observation, games designed for vertical screen is much more user-friendly than horizontal, because they only need one hand to play, and the comfort-zone to reach is larger.

                    <h3>Part 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this studio project, I choose Sherlock Holmes as my topic and decide to make an introduction page for information related to Holmes and his cases. I think this photo is very interesting because it contains no human beings, only an assortment of objects: a beret as a symbol of Sherlock Holmes, a pocket watch, a pipe, a magnifying glass and a map of the city of London. None of these items are labeled as belonging to anyone, but the combination of these elements makes it easy to think of a related subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love mystery stories, especially Sherlock Holmes‘ stories, so I wanted to make the webpage interactive to give users a sense of exploration as if they were reading a mystery novel. When the user clicks on an item, or a specific point on the map, they will find more detailed information and hints.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Part 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        My partner for this assignment is Roberto, and the image he sent me is simple but interesting. The main body of the image is a white Nike sneaker with a simple hand-painted logo and two striking points: the NIKE BLAZER MID located at the vamp, which I assume is the sneaker style, and the 1977 at the toe of the shoe looks like a special year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't know much about sneakers, so this information is all from observation. I'm curious as to what Roberto is trying to represent with this image, perhaps his love of sports, or perhaps his interest in collecting special sneakers?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">Michael Gonchar’s article</a>, he shared 10 intriguing photographs that he thought can improve viewers’ close reading and visual thinking skills. Individual photographs may be able to represent a complete story, but how to arouse the reader's curiosity to explore the details hidden in the images is a question that needs further consideration. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is difference between photographs and websites is that users can interact with the website itself, and the action that clicking in a website already represent the curiosity of the user to gain the information inside the site. So, the easiest and most intuitive way is to make the site cooler and to present more information to the reader with maximum efficiency in the process of this interactivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a case study for this studio, I browsed <a href="https://lens.science.clinic/">LENS by Science</a> and was surprised to realize how interactive a professional web designer can make a website. The pages themselves are dynamic throughout the browsing process, and the switching between pages is animated. I think the most interesting point is the change of the mouse cursor: when the user's cursor crosses a specific text or image, the area represented by the cursor will be enlarged and more detailed information will be provided in this area. In addition, the design of the site has a lot of white space and leaves the main visual area for images rather than text.

                    <p>
                        The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best
                        Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> introduced several interesting
                        details about the overlaying windows displayed on the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my practical use, the modals are usually the login or registration screens. This article
                        mentions that error, success, and warning messages should not be displayed as overlay windows,
                        because they are likely to forget the details on them after the user closes the interface. But I
                        think these types of windows can also be used as overlay windows to deepen the user's
                        impression, as long as the information they express will stay on the main page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think we should make multiple sketches before confirming the style and size of the pop-up
                        window, and think about what style is the most convenient and appropriate in terms of user
                        experience.

                        The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best
                            Practices
                            for Form Design</a> provides many useful techniques that helps to increase
                        the user experience when inserting a form inside a website. There are many details mentioned in
                        the
                        article that I had never noticed before, such as how to distinguish optional and required
                        fields. In
                        my actual use, there are actually many websites that still use the wrong examples mentioned in
                        the
                        article, such as using asterisk to mark optional items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the things that surprised me the most was the statement in the project about using
                        placeholder text that the disadvantages of placeholder texts outweigh the advantages in
                        practice, so
                        it is better to put it outside the text box as a hint. Based on my personal user experience
                        alone,
                        placeholder text is very convenient. This comparison makes me realize that the vast majority of
                        users' experiences may be different from my own. In the design process, it is important to
                        consider
                        solving most of the problems that may exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the form design of <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">google account sign up
                            page</a>
                        is a good example. Although it has placeholder text, when user click the textbox, the
                        placeholder text
                        would disappear, and the same text appears above the textbox instead, to remind the user what
                        should
                        they input.
                    </p>
