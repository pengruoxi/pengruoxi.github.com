            <h3>Observation & Reflection</h3>
            <p>Thanks to my testers, Hannah Moon, Jessica Lo, and Jenny Wong</p>

                <h3>Observation</h3>
                <p>
                    I found that all of my testers did not realize the name changing and color changing at the very
                    beginning. Basically, they read through all the information about the game rules, then realize that
                    there are more content at the bottom. One of the testers found out that she could change her name and
                    choose a color on the introductory screen when she played the game for the second time, but she didn't
                    know what the color choice would do until she entered the game. The other two testers read the rules
                    before they saw this section and tried to change their names and colors before entering the game.
                </p>

                    The second observation that I think important is the display of drop-down menu. One tester did not
                    notice the triangle and “Menu” at the top center of the screen, but the other two testers both said the
                    design was conspicuous. When the drop-down menu is retracted, the whole screen will look very blank.
                    This is because the top half of the page has basically no content other than the menu. When the page
                    size does not match 1366*768, the entire page elements are offset, and part of the drop-down menu is
                    displayed on the side of the introduction page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also realized that there are some problems happen on the color changing window showing in the game
                    process. I put two buttons here for applying the change and quit the overlay window, but my testers all
                    feel hesitate to click any of them when they first use this function. According to the advice during the
                    discussion, one of them said that she was not sure whether the quit button will quit the whole game or
                    just leave the color changing window. I also find that when tester open the color changing pop-up, the
                    drop-down menu can still work, which makes the webpage seems kind of weird.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    I will add more instructions in the introduction page to tell what users can do, and put the area for
                    personalization closer to the middle, to make it more eye-catching. Also, for the pop-up window of color
                    changing, I will delete the quit button, and only have an apply button. When player click the apply, the
                    window will automatically disappear. I might also make some minor adjustments to the drop-down menu so
                    that it doesn't fall down when the overlay window is displayed.
